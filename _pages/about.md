Hello :wave: , I'm Rasika Warade, and currently from New York - New Jersey area, USA.

I am professionally a developer Shopify. I have an eclectic range of interests, and this blog would serve as an opportunity to share and learn about those interests. I enjoy coffee :coffee: , driving :car: , and comfort food :rice:. The secret you will discover about me is mostly that I love singing :microphone: and dancing :dancer:.

It's my goal to learn :books: and write :pencil2: in public this year, and I'm so excited about it. 2021 wasn't my year for creation, but so far, 2022 looks promising :high_brightness: .
