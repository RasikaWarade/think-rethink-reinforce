            "content": "Chrome Extension Manifest Version 3 + Webpack . Boilerplate Code . Find the codebase in the github link here. . The Chrome Extension boilerplate uses Webpack to speed up the process of writing modular Javascript code, loading HTML and CSS easily, and automatically refresh the browser based on changes. . Why? . As per the Chrome Extension Timeline, all extensions supporting Manifest Version v2 will sunset in Jan 2023, and for new extensions, it has now become a requirement to move to Manifest Version V3. . Google Chrome Extension Manifest v3’s most significant security change is that remotely hosted code, such as Javascript, is now not allowed. If your extension codebase is not bundled and structured in a modular fashion, this can lead to problems. A beginner like me will definitely have a hard time building a setup like that without any guideline. . When I built my Chrome Extension, I had limited experience with webpack, and I believe that new beginners may have the same issue, which is why I decided to compile this resource. . Structure . I am assuming you have taken look for introduction at the Chrome Extension docs and Webpack docs. . Also, if you are beginner, I am assuming you probably would have worked on the Getting Started Guide for extension. If not, I would give a quick look at it as well. . This repo bundles the code explained in the Getting Started Guide with Webpack. . Initial Setup . Make sure you have latest Node.js installed. . My current version: . (base) ➜ chrome-extension-mv3-webpack-boilerplate git:(main) ✗ node --version v16.13.1 (base) ➜ chrome-extension-mv3-webpack-boilerplate git:(main) ✗ npm --version 8.1.2 . Configuration . For the initial setup, below webpack bundles were installed: . npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli html-webpack-plugin clean-webpack-plugin copy-webpack-plugin . webpack.development.js . For Development Purposes, you can configure this script and run the command npm run build to reflect changes. . webpack.production.js . For production release, you can configure this script and run the command npm run release to reflect changes. . webpack.common.js . This script contains all the common bundler config common between development and production scripts above. . src . All the html/css files and manifest.json are added in this directory. . Includes: . background.js | content.js | popup (js + html + css) | options (js + html) | . src/manifest.json . This is the entry point for your extension. . { &quot;manifest_version&quot;: 3, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.1&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MV3 Extension with Webpack&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Webpack Modular Framework!&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: { &quot;default_popup&quot;: &quot;./popup.html&quot;, &quot;default_icon&quot;: { &quot;16&quot;: &quot;./src/icons/get_started16.png&quot;, &quot;32&quot;: &quot;./src/icons/get_started32.png&quot;, &quot;48&quot;: &quot;./src/icons/get_started48.png&quot;, &quot;128&quot;: &quot;./src/icons/get_started128.png&quot; }, &quot;default_title&quot;: &quot;Getting Started MV3!&quot; }, &quot;permissions&quot;: [ &quot;storage&quot;, &quot;activeTab&quot;, &quot;scripting&quot; ], &quot;content_scripts&quot;: [ { &quot;matches&quot;: [ &quot;&lt;all_urls&gt;&quot; ], &quot;js&quot;: [ &quot;content.js&quot; ] } ], &quot;background&quot;: { &quot;service_worker&quot;: &quot;background.js&quot; }, &quot;icons&quot;: { &quot;16&quot;: &quot;./src/icons/get_started16.png&quot;, &quot;32&quot;: &quot;./src/icons/get_started32.png&quot;, &quot;48&quot;: &quot;./src/icons/get_started48.png&quot;, &quot;128&quot;: &quot;./src/icons/get_started128.png&quot; }, &quot;options_page&quot;: &quot;options.html&quot; } . How to use it . Clone the repo | Run command npm install to install all node-modules / dependencies | Run command npm run build | This will build the dist folder | Load the Chrome Extension you just build by pointing to this dist folder | Note: gitignore will help ignore the node_modules and dist folder to be pushed to the github . What’s Next! . Feel free to use this template as boilerplate and update as per your own requirements. As I mentioned this bundling would help when you want to access some remotely hosted code / libraries, and in my next blog you will see an example of I utilized it. .",
